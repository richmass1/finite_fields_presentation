    "## Review: What is a field?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lecture 7 has information on fields, but that was a while ago, so here's a review of the basics. A field is a special type of ring, and a ring is a special type of group, so fields are just really special groups. Recall that a ring is a set of numbers that has two operations defined on it: an addition-like operation, denoted +, and a multiplication-like operation, denoted $\\cdot$ or \\*, where \\* must always have the distributive property over +. In a ring, every element must have an additive inverse. The integers are an example of a ring, and the definition of addition and multiplication on the integers is precisely the definition that we're used to.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how is a field different? A field must have a multiplicative inverse for *every* element, except for 0. The integers are not a field, because the integer 2 (among others) doesn't have a multiplicative inverse (i.e., there's no integer that you can multiply by 2 to get 1). \n",

    "- Integers\n",
    "- Integers mod *n* where *n* is composite\n",

    "## The Rijndael cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1997, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) held a contest where mathematicians were asked to devise new symmetric ciphers. (Symmetric ciphers are those which have the same decryption key as encryption key, like the Vigenere cipher.) The winner was a cipher called Rijndael, created by two Belgian mathematicians, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. As the winner of the contest, Rijndael was adopted as the NIST's new Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Since then, it has proven resistant to attacks, and remains one of the world's most widely-used symmetric cryptosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why use a symmetric cryptosystem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Though cryptosystems like RSA and ElGamal offer great utility by being asymmetric, they're impractical for encrypting large quantities of information; they're slow and require enormous amounts of memory. In practice, information is encrypted symmetrically, and only the symmetric key is encrypted asymmetrically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "Rijndael is a block cipher, which means that it splits the plaintext up into blocks of a fixed size and treats these blocks as independent of each other. The version of Rijndael adopted as AES uses blocks of 128 bits (16 bytes). In case you don't know, a bit is a **b**inary dig**it**, i.e. a 1 or a 0, and a byte is 8 bits. In the ASCII encoding, one character is one byte, so for a simple .txt file with no special characters, a block would be 16 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rijndael consists of a number of \"rounds\" of encryption on the plaintext, where each round (except the last) is the same, and the number of rounds is 10, 12, or 14 depending on the length of the key. Each round, except the last one, consists of these 4 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SubBytes\n",
    "2. ShiftRows\n",
    "3. MixColumns\n",
    "4. AddRoundKey\n",
    "\n",
    "The last round is different in that it lacks the MixColumns step. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Expansion\n",
    "Before encrypting the plaintext, the key must be expanded so that its total number of bits is the block length (128) times the number of rounds plus 1. This allows us to split the key up into a number of chunks, so that each chunk is the same length as the block, and the number of chunks is 1 more than the number of rounds. The details of how this is done are really complicated, so I'm skipping it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SubBytes\n",
    "Since each byte consists of 8 bits, and each bit can be 0 or 1, the set of all possible bytes has $2^8$ elements. As this is a prime power, there exists a field with this many elements, and in such a field, we can have the coefficients of a polynomial correspond to the bits of a byte. For example, the byte 01001001 would correspond to $x^6+x^3+1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rijndael uses the field $\\mathbb{Z}_2[x]/(p(x)\\cdot\\mathbb{Z}_2[x])$ where $p(x)=x^8+x^4+x^3+x+1$. This field will be referred to as $GF(2^8)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of SubBytes is to represent each byte as a polynomial, then find that polynomial's multiplicative inverse in $GF(2^8)$. 0 doesn't have an inverse, so if the byte is 0 the inversion is skipped and the byte remains 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the byte is represented as a vector of 8 bits, and is multiplied by this matrix:\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1&1&1&1&1&0&0&0\\\\0&1&1&1&1&1&0&0\\\\0&0&1&1&1&1&1&0\\\\0&0&0&1&1&1&1&1\\\\1&0&0&0&1&1&1&1\\\\1&1&0&0&0&1&1&1\\\\1&1&1&0&0&0&1&1\\\\1&1&1&1&0&0&0&1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "Followed by a element-wise XOR with the vector $[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1]$. XOR is a function that takes two bits and returns a 1 if they are different, or a 0 if they are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ShiftRows\n",
    "In this step, the block's 16 bytes are rearranged. The block is represented as a 4x4 grid of bytes, with bytes 1-4 in the leftmost column, bytes 5-8 in the next column, and so on. The second row is shifted 1 to the left, the third row is shifted 2 to the left, and the fourth row is shifted 3 to the left. \n",
